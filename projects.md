# Current projects

CTI 27674.1 PFES-ES

* With Petr Motlicek and a "global industry partner", we aim to bring speech to
  consumer grade embedded systems.

DeepCharisma

* Working with Olivier Bornet, John Antonakis and Dominic Rohner, we try to
  infer charisma using deep learning.

MASS

* MASS is "Multilingual Affective Speech Synthesis".  It continues the work
  begun in SIWIS and SP2 by attempting to model the prosody of emotion.

SUMMA

* [SUMMA](http://www.summa-project.eu/) is an H2020 funded project on big data
  and multilingual speech processing.

# Previous projects

Swisscom

* With Alexandros Lazaridis, before he moved to Swisscom.

SP2

* [SP2](http://p3.snf.ch/project-152495) was the
  "[SCOPES](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/scopes/Pages/default.aspx)
  project on Speech Prosody".  It was a collaboration with BME-TMIT in
  Budapest, FEEIT in Skopje and the RTD group at UNS in Novi Sad.

SIWIS

* [SIWIS](http://www.idiap.ch/project/siwis/) was a
  [sinergia](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/sinergia/Pages/default.aspx)
  project funded by [SNSF](http://www.snf.ch/).  At Idiap it funded Alexandros
  Lazaridis and Pierre-Edouard Honnet.

armasuisse

* This work was with Petr Motlicek and Milos Cernak for the
  [defence procurement](http://www.ar.admin.ch/internet/armasuisse/en/home.html)
  arm of the Swiss government.  We aim to use the synthesis technology from
  EMIME to do low bit rate coding.

Samsung GRO

* Working with Petr Motlicek and
  [Samsung's SAIT lab](http://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/) under the
  [GRO program](http://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/01_about/gro_overview.jsp)
  on advanced multi-lingual acoustic modelling for speech recognition.  The
  project continued, funded directly by SAIT.

MediaParl

* This is a project aiming to do speech recognition and indexing of the
  Valaisan parliament.  It was run by Alexandre Nanchen; I helped where
  possible along with Gy√∂rgy Szaszak.

V-FAST

* Another [Hasler Foundation](http://www.haslerstiftung.ch/en/home) project
  related to CLAS3, but focussed on fast adaptation using vocal tract
  normalisation methods developed by Lakshmi Saheer.

CLAS3

* This was a [Hasler Foundation](http://www.haslerstiftung.ch/en/home) funded
  project allowing Hui Liang to finish his PhD work.  The cross lingual
  adaptation techniques that Hui developed are the basis for SIWIS.

EMIME

* I worked on [EMIME](http://www.emime.org/) with John Dines, Lakshmi Saheer
  and Hui Liang.  That project continued in a Swiss sense as SIWIS.

AMIDA

* I worked on [AMIDA](http://www.amiproject.org/) until it finished at the end
  of 2009. That work continued under [IM2](http://www.im2.ch/). It was closely
  related to the [TA2](http://www.ta2-project.eu/) project.
