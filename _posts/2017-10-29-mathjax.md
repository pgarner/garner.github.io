{% include mathjax.html %}

This should be an equation:

$$
x = \frac{2}{\alpha}
$$

The [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) page suggests
putting the script in the header portion of the page.  That involves messing
with the layout though, and I really don't want to do that.  It works perfectly
well at the top of the content.  In fact, it's in `_includes`, and you just
need the Liquid `include` tag in the post.
