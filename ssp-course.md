# Overview

A while back, I taught a PhD level course on speech signal processing.  The
content here is two-thirds of the course.  It was complemented by content by
Fabio Valente (in 2009 and 2011) and Milos Cernak (in 2013).

# Slides

The course covered a fourteen week semester.  Below are slides from the
lectures that I gave.  The missing weeks are laboratory excercises and lectures
taught by my colleagues.

Caveat: Some of the slides above contain images "from the web" that omit an
attribution or copyright.  It's my bad; I'll fix them as I find them.
