# Overview

A while back, I taught a PhD level course on speech signal processing.  It was
complemented by content by Fabio Valente (in 2009 and 2011) and Milos Cernak
(in 2013).

# Slides

The course covered a fourteen week semester.  Below are slides from the
lectures that Milos and I gave.  The missing weeks are laboratory excercises.

* [Week 1](ssp-course/week01.pdf)

Caveat: Some of the slides above contain images "from the web" that omit an
attribution or copyright.  It's my bad; I'll fix them as I find them.
