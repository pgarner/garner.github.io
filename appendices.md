# Some signal processing and statistical appendices

Sometimes, just to understand something, I write an appendix...

* A derivation of [Fourier transforms](appendices/fourier.pdf)
* Two derivations of
  [Laplace transforms and z-transforms](appendices/laplace.pdf)
* A note on the [real and complex cepstrum](appendices/cepstrum.pdf)
* A derivation of the [EM algorithm](appendices/em.pdf)
* A derivation of the [Kalman filter and Kalman smoother](appendices/kalman.pdf)
* The origin of the
  [multivariate normal distribution](appendices/multivariate-normal.pdf)
* The [Complex Gaussian distribution](appendices/complex-gaussian.pdf)
* [Convolution of two complex Gaussians](appendices/convolution.pdf)
* Maximum likelihood and MAP derivations of
  [linear prediction](appendices/linear-model.pdf)
* A derivation of a [second order damped system](appendices/damping.pdf)
* How to derive a [Student-t from a Gaussian](appendices/gaussian.pdf)
* A note on [sparse conditional probability](appendices/sparse-cond.pdf)
