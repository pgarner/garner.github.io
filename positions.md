# Overview

We are always looking for good people at Idiap.  Any open position will be
advertised on the
[Idiap jobs page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/join-us/job-opportunities); these are
all funded.  There are speculative positions there too; these are not funded,
but are useful if you anticipate a position being available soon, or if you
have your own funding.

# Currently open

There are several postdoc positions open on quite large international projects:

* [Multilingual speech processing and cross-lingual indexing](http://www.idiap.ch/education-and-jobs/job-10223)

Idiap can be a good place to do a post-doc.  If you want an academic career, it
is a springboard to a position elsewhere.  If you want to run a startup, it is
easy to transition into the [IdeArk incubator](http://www.ideark.ch/en/).  If
you are undecided, a post-doc can provide time to make an informed decision.
