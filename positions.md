# Overview

We are always looking for good people at Idiap.  Any open position will be
advertised on the
[Idiap jobs page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/join-us/job-opportunities); all are
funded except the speculative positions.  A speculative application is useful
if you anticipate a position being available soon, or if you have your own
funding.

# Post doctoral researchers

There are several postdoc positions open, mainly on collaborations within
Switzerland.  They are representated by this post:

* [Natural language processing and understanding in the context of speech recognition](http://www.idiap.ch/education-and-jobs/job-10251)

Idiap can be a good place to do a post-doc.  If you want an academic career, it
is a springboard to a position elsewhere.  If you want to run a startup, it is
easy to transition into the [IdeArk incubator](http://www.ideark.ch/en/).  If
you are undecided, a post-doc can provide time to make an informed decision.

# Interns

I have one intern opening

* [Spiking Networks for Prosody Synthesis](http://www.idiap.ch/education-and-jobs/job-10231)

Unless you have your own funding, interns are funded by Idiap with a stipend of
CHF 2,000 per month.  In Martigny, this will pay rent, food and (some) beer;
you probably won't save anything.  An internship is suitable for someone doing
a masters and needing a project, or with a masters waiting to take a PhD
position.  It may also suit a PhD student wanting to broaden their knowledge.
An internship is not suitable for a PhD graduate unless you have a very clear
idea of where you're going next.
