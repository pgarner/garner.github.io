# Who?

![Mugshot](assets/mugshot.jpg){:width="15%"}

I work within the broader Speech and Audio Processing group at
[Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/), with particular focus on the
conjunction of speech recognition and speech synthesis.  In each case, I try to
focus on physiologically plausible systems. Here is a short
[bio](ieee-bio.html).

# Paper trail

* My [reviewed publications](phil-pubs.html). These are also indexed by
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=KyNTbPkAAAAJ) and
[ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_Garner).  Of these,
Google Scholar is probably the most accurate.

* A (possibly incomplete) list of [my patents](phil-pats.html). They are
mainly US, but in practice most of these began life as either GB or Japan
patents; the US ones are just easier to reference.

* Other [technical reports](phil-tech.html) that are not commercial in
confidence or published elsewhere. The list includes some MPEG submissions that
made it into MPEG-7.

# Contact

Look at the URL above and figure out my email address. It'll probably get
here. Otherwise try the
[Idiap contact page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/people/directory/306).

# Software

* [ISS](https://github.com/idiap/iss) is a framework for building and
evaluating ASR models.
* [SSP](https://github.com/idiap/ssp) is a signal processing library in python.
It contains, amongst other things, a feature extractor and
[continuous pitch estimator](http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/2451).
* [libssp](https://github.com/idiap/libssp) duplicates some functionality of
SSP in a C++ library.
* [Juicer](http://juicer.amiproject.org/juicer) is a collection of ASR decoders.  It is not currently under active development; most of the functionality is available in [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org).  However,
* I wrote and actively maintain
[Tracter](http://juicer.amiproject.org/tracter), a data-flow framework that
forms the feature acquisition mechanism of Juicer.  Tracter wraps several other
packages, including libssp.

More recent work is on my [GitHub](http://github.com/pgarner) page.

# Teaching

I hold a [lecturer position](http://people.epfl.ch/philip.garner) at
[EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), and (a while ago now) taught a
[course on Speech Signal Processing](ssp-course).

# Also...

For a long while I wasn't in [facebook](facebook.html). I've since bought into
the social networking world, including
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/philipngarner).
